```

**Scan focusing on specific categories:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration scan this notebook for Spark Connect compatibility issues
```

```
@databricks-dbr-migration check this Scala file for Scala 2.13 breaking changes
```

### Multi-File and Folder Scans

**Scan entire folder recursively:**

```

**Fix with backup:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration fix all breaking changes and create a backup of the original file
```

### Targeted Fixes

**Fix only HIGH severity issues:**
```

```

---

## Validation Prompts

### Post-Fix Validation

**Verify fixes were applied:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration validate that all breaking changes have been addressed
```

**Check for remaining issues:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration scan this notebook again to confirm no breaking changes remain
```

**Validate specific fixes:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration verify that all input_file_name() references have been replaced correctly
```

### Syntax and Quality Checks

**Check for syntax errors after fixes:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration validate Python syntax in all files I just modified
```

**Validate imports:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration check that all imports are still valid after the fixes
```

### Cross-File Validation

**Validate multi-file changes:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration validate that changes in main_notebook.py are compatible with updates in utils/helpers.py
```

---

## Multi-File Project Prompts

### Project-Wide Operations

```

**Fix utility module and dependents:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration fix breaking changes in utils/helpers.py and update all notebooks that import from it
```

## Troubleshooting Prompts

### When Fixes Don't Work

**Verify fix was applied correctly:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration the input_file_name() fix didn't work, can you show me what changed and verify the syntax?
```

**Re-scan after manual changes:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration I manually fixed some issues, can you re-scan and tell me what's left?
```

### Understanding Errors

**Explain error message:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration I'm getting "AnalysisException: Undefined function: input_file_name" - what does this mean and how do I fix it?
```

**Debug failed fix:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration the fix for BC-15.4-003 caused a syntax error, can you review and correct it?
```

### False Positives

**Report false positive:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration you flagged line 42 as using input_file_name() but it's in a comment - can you re-scan?
```

**Verify specific pattern:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration double-check if this code pattern is actually a breaking change or a false positive
```

---

## Advanced Prompts

### Custom Scans

**Scan for specific pattern:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration search for all DataFrame operations that might be affected by Spark Connect lazy evaluation
```

**Find deprecated patterns:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration find all deprecated Spark APIs in this notebook even if they're not breaking changes yet
```

### Reporting

**Generate detailed report:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration create a detailed migration report with all findings, fixes applied, and remaining manual tasks
```

**Export findings to CSV format:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration list all breaking changes in a table format with columns: File, Line, BC-ID, Severity, Status
```

### Batch Operations

**Process multiple notebooks:**
```
@databricks-dbr-migration scan all notebooks in the folder list: notebook1.py, notebook2.py, notebook3.py and summarize findings
```

## Best Practices for Prompts

### ✅ DO

1. **Be specific about target DBR version:**
   - ✅ "scan for DBR 17.3 compatibility"
   - ❌ "scan for issues"

2. **Mention file scope explicitly:**
   - ✅ "scan this notebook and all files in utils/"
   - ❌ "scan everything"

3. **Request categorized output:**
   - ✅ "categorize findings: auto-fix, manual, config"
   - ❌ "find problems"

4. **Use breaking change IDs when known:**
   - ✅ "fix BC-17.3-001"
   - ❌ "fix the file name thing"

5. **Ask for validation after fixes:**
   - ✅ "fix all issues then validate"
   - ❌ "just fix it"

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Don't use vague language:**
   - ❌ "check for stuff that might break"
   - ✅ "scan for breaking changes from DBR 13.3 to 17.3"

2. **Don't assume context:**
   - ❌ "fix it" (what is "it"?)
   - ✅ "fix the input_file_name() issues in this notebook"

3. **Don't skip validation:**
   - ❌ "fix and we're done"
   - ✅ "fix then validate no issues remain"

4. **Don't ignore multi-file dependencies:**
   - ❌ "just fix this one file"
   - ✅ "fix this file and check imported modules"
